In the command line flag definitions that follow,
  * <angle brackets> denote a required parameter, where the text between the
    angle brackets describes its nature.
  * ['square brackets + single-quotes'] denotes an optional modifier.  Use the
    EXACT text in the quotes.
  * [{bar|separated|braced|bracketed|values}] denotes a collection of mutually
    exclusive optional modifiers (again, the exact text must be used).  When
    there are no outer square brackets, one of the choices must be selected.
  * ['quoted_text='<description of value>] denotes an optional modifier that
    must begin with the quoted text, and be followed by a value with no
    whitespace in between.  '|' may also be used here to indicate mutually
    exclusive options.
  * [square brackets without quotes or braces] denote an optional parameter,
    where the text between the brackets describes its nature.
  * An ellipsis (...) indicates that you may enter multiple arguments of the
    specified type.
  * A "column set descriptor" is either
    1. a comma-separated sequence of column set names; this is interpreted as
       the full list of column sets to include.
    2. a comma-separated sequence of column set names, all preceded by '+' or
       '-'; this is interpreted as a list of changes to the default.

  plink2 <input flag(s)...> [command flag(s)...] [other flag(s)...]
  plink2 --help [flag name(s)...]

Most PLINK runs require exactly one main input fileset.  The following flags
are available for defining its form and location:

  --pfile <prefix> ['vzs']  : Specify .pgen[ + .pgen.pgi] + .pvar[.zst] +
                              .psam prefix.
  --pgen <filename>         : Specify full name of .pgen/.bed file.
  --pgi <filename>          : Specify full name of .pgen.pgi file.
  --pvar <filename>         : Specify full name of .pvar/.bim file.
  --psam <filename>         : Specify full name of .psam/.fam file.

  --bfile  <prefix> ['vzs'] : Specify .bed + .bim[.zst] + .fam prefix.
  --bpfile <prefix> ['vzs'] : Specify .pgen + .bim[.zst] + .fam prefix.

  --keep-autoconv ['vzs']   : When importing non-PLINK-binary data, don't
                              delete autogenerated fileset at end of run.

  --no-fid           : .fam file does not contain column 1 (family ID).
  --no-parents       : .fam file does not contain columns 3-4 (parents).
  --no-sex           : .fam file does not contain column 5 (sex).

  --vcf <filename> ['dosage='<field>]
  --bcf <filename> ['dosage='<field>] :
    Specify full name of .vcf{|.gz|.zst} or BCF2 file to import.
    * These can be used with --psam/--fam.
    * By default, dosage information is not imported.  To import the GP field
      (must be VCFv4.3-style 0..1, one probability per possible genotype), add
      'dosage=GP' (or 'dosage=GP-force', see below).  To import Minimac3-style
      DS+HDS phased dosage, add 'dosage=HDS'.  'dosage=DS' (or anything else
      for now) causes the named field to be interpreted as a Minimac3-style
      dosage.
      Note that, in the dosage=GP case, PLINK 2 collapses the probabilities
      down to dosages; you cannot use PLINK 2 to losslessly convert VCF
      FORMAT/GP data to e.g. BGEN format.  To make this more obvious, PLINK 2
      now errors out when dosage=GP is used on a file with a FORMAT/DS header
      line and --import-dosage-certainty wasn't specified, since dosage=DS
      extracts the same information more quickly in this situation.  You can
      suppress this error with 'dosage=GP-force'.
      In all of these cases, hardcalls are regenerated from scratch from the
      dosages.  As a consequence, variants with no GT field can now be
      imported; they will be assumed to contain only diploid calls when HDS is
      also absent.

  --data <filename prefix> <REF/ALT mode> ['gzs']
  --bgen <filename> <REF/ALT mode> ['snpid-chr']
  --gen <filename> <REF/ALT mode>
  --sample <filename> :
    Specify an Oxford-format dataset to import.  --data specifies a .gen[.zst]
    + .sample pair, while --bgen specifies a BGEN v1.1+ file.
    * If a BGEN v1.2+ file contains sample IDs, it may be imported without a
      companion .sample file.
    * With 'snpid-chr', chromosome codes are read from the 'SNP ID' field
      instead of the usual chromosome field.
    * The following REF/ALT modes are supported:
      'ref-first': The first allele for each variant is REF.
      'ref-last': The last allele for each variant is REF.
      'ref-unknown': The last allele for each variant is treated as
                     provisional-REF.

  --haps <filename> [{ref-first | ref-last}]
  --legend <filename> <chr code> :
    Specify .haps [+ .legend] file(s) to import.
    * When --legend is specified, it's assumed that the --haps file doesn't
      contain header columns.
    * On chrX, the second male column may contain dummy '-' entries.  (However,
      PLINK 2 currently cannot handle omitted male columns.)
    * If not used with --sample, new sample IDs are of the form 'per#/per#'.

  --pedmap <prefix>  : Specify .ped + .map filename prefix.
  --ped <filename>   : Specify full name of .ped file.
  --map <filename>   : Specify full name of .map file.

  --tfile <prefix>   : Specify .tped + .tfam filename prefix.
  --tped <filename>  : Specify full name of .tped file.
  --tfam <filename>  : Specify full name of .tfam file.

  --import-dosage <allele dosage file> ['noheader'] ['id-delim='<char>]
                  ['skip0='<i>] ['skip1='<j>] ['skip2='<k>] ['dose1']
                  ['format='<m>] [{ref-first | ref-last}]
                  ['single-chr='<code>] ['chr-col-num='<#>]
                  ['pos-col-num='<#>] :
    Specify PLINK 1.x-style dosage file to import.
    * You must also specify a companion .psam/.fam file.
    * By default, PLINK assumes that the file contains a header line, which has
      'SNP' in (1-based) column i+1, 'A1' in column i+j+2, 'A2' in column
      i+j+3, and sample FID/IIDs starting from column i+j+k+4.  (i/j/k are
      normally zero, but can be changed with 'skip0', 'skip1', and 'skip2'
      respectively.  FID/IID are normally assumed to be separate tokens, but if
      they're merged into a single token you can specify the delimiter with
      'id-delim='.)  If such a header line is not present, use the 'noheader'
      modifier; samples will then be assumed to appear in the same order as
      they do in the .psam/.fam file.
    * You may specify a companion .map file.  If you do not,
      * 'single-chr=' can be used to specify that all variants are on the named
        chromosome.  Otherwise, you can use 'chr-col-num=' to read chromosome
        codes from the given (1-based) column number.
      * 'pos-col-num=' causes bp coordinates to be read from the given column
        number.
    * The 'format=' modifier lets you specify the number of values used to
      represent each dosage.  'format=1' normally indicates a single 0..2 A1
      expected count; 'dose1' modifies this to a 0..1 frequency.  'format=2'
      indicates a 0..1 homozygous A1 likelihood followed by a 0..1 het
      likelihood.  'format=3' indicates 0..1 hom A1, 0..1 het, 0..1 hom A2.
      'format=infer' (the default) infers the format from the number of columns
      in the first nonheader line.

  --dummy <sample ct> <SNP ct> [missing dosage freq(s)] [missing pheno freq]
          [{acgt | 1234 | 12}] ['pheno-ct='<count>] ['scalar-pheno']
          ['phase-freq='<rate>] ['dosage-freq='<rate>]
    This generates a fake input dataset with the specified number of samples
    and SNPs.
    * By default, the missing dosage frequency is zero.  This can be changed by
      providing a comma-separated list of possible frequencies (one frequency
      in the list is selected for each variant).
    * By default, the missing phenotype frequency is zero.  This can be changed
      by providing both a dosage-frequency and a 4th numeric argument; the 4th
      argument is then interpreted as the missing phenotype frequency.
    * By default, allele codes are As and Bs; this can be changed with the
      'acgt', '1234', or '12' modifier.
    * By default, one binary phenotype is generated.  'pheno-ct=' can be used
      to change the number of phenotypes, and 'scalar-pheno' causes these
      phenotypes to be normally distributed scalars.
    * By default, all genotypes/dosages are unphased.  To phase some of them,
      use 'phase-freq='.
    * By default, all dosages are in {0,1,2}.  To make some of them take on
      decimal values, use 'dosage-freq='.  (These dosages are affected by
      --hard-call-threshold and --dosage-erase-threshold.)

  --fa <filename>    : Specify full name of reference FASTA file.

Output files have names of the form 'plink2.<extension>' by default.  You can
change the 'plink2' prefix with

  --out <prefix>     : Specify prefix for output files.

Most runs also require at least one of the following commands:

  --rm-dup [mode] ['list']
    Remove all but one instance of each duplicate-ID variant (ignoring the
    missing ID), and (with the 'list' modifier) write a list of duplicated IDs
    to <output prefix>.rmdup.list.
    The following modes of operation are supported:
    * 'error' (default) causes this to error out when there's a genotype data
      or other mismatch between the records.  A list of affected IDs is written
      to <output prefix>.rmdup.mismatch.
    * 'retain-mismatch' causes all instances of a duplicate-ID variant to be
      retained when there's a genotype data or variant info mismatch; otherwise
      one instance is kept.  The .rmdup.mismatch file is also written.
    * 'exclude-mismatch' removes all instances of duplicate-ID mismatched
      variants instead.
    * 'exclude-all' causes all instances of duplicate-ID variants to be
      removed, even when the actual records are identical.
    * 'force-first' causes only the first instance of duplicate-ID variants to
      be kept, under all circumstances.

  --make-pgen ['vzs'] ['format='<code>] ['trim-alts'] ['erase-phase']
              ['erase-dosage'] ['fill-missing-from-dosage']
              ['pvar-cols='<col set desc>] ['psam-cols='<col set desc>]
  --make-bpgen ['vzs'] ['format='<code>] ['trim-alts'] ['erase-phase']
               ['erase-dosage'] ['fill-missing-from-dosage']
  --make-bed ['vzs'] ['trim-alts']
    Create a new PLINK 2 binary fileset (--make-pgen = .pgen + .pvar[.zst] +
    .psam, --make-bpgen = .pgen + .bim[.zst] + .fam).
    * Unlike the automatic text-to-binary converters (which only heed
      chromosome filters), this supports all of PLINK's filtering flags.
    * The 'vzs' modifier causes the variant file (.pvar/.bim) to be
      Zstd-compressed.
    * The 'format' modifier requests an uncompressed fixed-variant-width .pgen
      file.  (These do not directly support multiallelic variants.)  The
      following format code is currently supported:
        2: just like .bed, except with an extended (12-byte instead of 3-byte)
           header containing variant/sample counts, and rotated genotype codes
           (00 = hom ref, 01 = het, 10 = hom alt, 11 = missing).
    * The 'erase-phase' and 'erase-dosage' modifiers prevent phase and dosage
      information from being written to the new .pgen.
    * When a hardcall is missing but the corresponding dosage is present,
      'fill-missing-from-dosage' causes the (Euclidean-)nearest hardcall to be
      filled in, with ties broken in favor of the lower-index allele.
    * The first five columns of a .pvar file are always #CHROM/POS/ID/REF/ALT.
      Supported optional .pvar column sets are:
        xheader: All pre-#CHROM header lines (yeah, this is technically not a
                 column), except for possibly FILTER/INFO definitions when
                 those column(s) have been removed.  Without this, only the
                 #CHROM header line is kept.
        vcfheader: xheader, with additions to make it a valid VCF header.
        maybequal: QUAL.  Omitted if all remaining values are missing.
        qual: Force QUAL column to be written even when empty.
        maybefilter: FILTER.  Omitted if all remaining values are missing.
        filter: Force FILTER column to be written even when empty.
        maybeinfo: INFO.  Omitted if all remaining values are missing, or if
                   INFO/PR is the only subfield.
        info: Force INFO column to be written.
        maybecm: Centimorgan coordinate.  Omitted if all remaining values = 0.
        cm: Force CM column to be written even when empty.
      The default is xheader,maybequal,maybefilter,maybeinfo,maybecm.
    * Supported column sets for the .psam file are:
        maybefid: Family ID, '0' = missing.  Omitted if all values missing.
        fid: Force FID column to be written even when empty.
        maybesid: Source ID, '0' = missing.  Omitted if all values missing.
        sid: Force SID column to be written even when empty.
        maybeparents: Father and mother IIDs.  Omitted if all values missing.
        parents: Force PAT and MAT columns to be written even when empty.
        sex: '1' = male, '2' = female, 'NA' = missing.
        pheno1: First active phenotype.  If none, all column entries are set to
                the --output-missing-phenotype string.
        phenos: All active phenotypes, if any.  (Can be combined with pheno1 to
                force at least one phenotype column to be written.)
      The default is maybefid,maybesid,maybeparents,sex,phenos.

  --make-just-pvar ['zs'] ['cols='<column set descriptor>]
  --make-just-psam ['cols='<column set descriptor>]
  --make-just-bim ['zs']
  --make-just-fam
    Variants of --make-pgen/--make-bed which only write a new variant or sample
    file.  These don't always require an input genotype file.
    USE THESE CAUTIOUSLY.  It is very easy to desynchronize your binary
    genotype data and your sample/variant indexes if you use these commands
    improperly.  If you have any doubt, stick with --make-[b]pgen/--make-bed.

  --export <output format(s)...> [{01 | 12}] ['bgz'] ['id-delim='<char>]
           ['id-paste='<column set descriptor>] ['include-alt']
           ['omit-nonmale-y'] ['spaces'] ['vcf-dosage='<field>] ['ref-first']
           ['bits='<#>] ['sample-v2']
    Create a new fileset with all filters applied.  The following output
    formats are supported:
    (actually, only A, AD, Av, bcf, bgen-1.x, haps, hapslegend, ind-major-bed,
    oxford, ped, tped, and vcf are implemented for now)
    * '23': 23andMe 4-column format.  This can only be used on a single
            sample's data (--keep may be handy), and does not support
            multicharacter allele codes.
    * 'A': Sample-major additive (0/1/2) coding, suitable for loading from R.
           If you need uncounted alleles to be named in the header line, add
           the 'include-alt' modifier.
    * 'AD': Sample-major additive (0/1/2) + dominant (het=1/hom=0) coding.
            Also supports 'include-alt'.
    * 'Av': Variant-major 0/1/2.
    * 'beagle': Unphased per-autosome .dat and .map files, readable by early
                BEAGLE versions.
    * 'beagle-nomap': Single .beagle.dat file.
    * 'bgen-1.x': Oxford-format .bgen + .sample.  For v1.2/v1.3, sample
                  identifiers are stored in the .bgen (with id-delim and
                  id-paste settings applied), and default precision is 16-bit
                  (use the 'bits' modifier to reduce this).
    * 'bimbam': Regular BIMBAM format.
    * 'bimbam-1chr': BIMBAM format, with a two-column .pos.txt file.  Does not
                     support multiple chromosomes.
    * 'fastphase': Per-chromosome fastPHASE files, with
                   .chr-<chr #>.phase.inp filename extensions.
    * 'fastphase-1chr': Single .phase.inp file.  Does not support
                        multiple chromosomes.
    * 'haps', 'hapslegend': Oxford-format .haps + .sample[ + .legend].  All
                            data must be biallelic and phased.  When the 'bgz'
                            modifier is present, the .haps file is
                            block-gzipped.
    * 'HV': Per-chromosome Haploview files, with .chr-<chr #>{.ped,.info}
            filename extensions.
    * 'HV-1chr': Single Haploview .ped + .info file pair.  Does not support
                 multiple chromosomes.
    * 'ind-major-bed': PLINK 1 sample-major .bed (+ .bim + .fam).
    * 'lgen': PLINK 1 long-format (.lgen + .fam + .map), loadable with --lfile.
    * 'lgen-ref': .lgen + .fam + .map + .ref, loadable with --lfile +
                  --reference.
    * 'list': Single genotype-based list, up to 4 lines per variant.  To omit
              nonmale genotypes on the Y chromosome, add the 'omit-nonmale-y'
              modifier.
    * 'rlist': .rlist + .fam + .map fileset, where the .rlist file is a
                genotype-based list which omits the most common genotype for
                each variant.  Also supports 'omit-nonmale-y'.
    * 'oxford', 'oxford-v2': Oxford-format .gen + .sample.  When the 'bgz'
                             modifier is present, the .gen file is
                             block-gzipped.  'oxford' requests the original
                             .gen file format with 5 leading columns
                             (understood by older PLINK builds); 'oxford-v2'
                             requests the current 6-leading-column flavor.
    * 'ped', 'compound-genotypes': PLINK 1 sample-major (.ped + .map),
                                   loadable with --pedmap.
    * 'structure': Structure-format.
    * 'tped': PLINK 1 variant-major (.tped + .tfam), loadable with --tfile.
    * 'vcf',     : VCF (default version 4.3).  If PAR1 and PAR2 are present,
      'vcf-4.2',   they are automatically merged with chrX, with proper
      'bcf',       handling of chromosome codes and male ploidy.
      'bcf-4.2'    When the 'bgz' modifier is present, the VCF file is
                   block-gzipped.  (This always happens with BCF output.)
                   The 'id-paste' modifier controls which .psam columns are
                   used to construct sample IDs (choices are maybefid, fid,
                   iid, maybesid, and sid; default is maybefid,iid,maybesid),
                   while the 'id-delim' modifier sets the character between the
                   ID pieces (default '_').
                   Genotypes are always exported.  If you want to export a
                   sites-only VCF instead, see --make-pgen/--make-just-pvar's
                   'vcfheader' column set.
                   Dosages are not exported unless the 'vcf-dosage=' modifier
                   is present.  The following six dosage export modes are
                   supported:
                   'GP': genotype posterior probabilities (v4.3 only).
                   'DS': Minimac3-style dosages, omitted for hardcalls.
                   'DS-force': Minimac3-style dosages, never omit.
                   'DS-only': Same as DS-force, except GT field is omitted.
                   'HDS': Minimac3-style phased dosages, omitted for hardcalls
                          and unphased calls.  Also includes 'DS' output.
                   'HDS-force': Always report DS and HDS.
    In addition,
    * The '12' modifier causes alt1 alleles to be coded as '1' and ref alleles
      to be coded as '2', while '01' maps alt1 -> 0 and ref -> 1.
    * The 'spaces' modifier makes the output space-delimited instead of
      tab-delimited, whenever both are permitted.
    * For biallelic formats where it's unspecified whether the reference/major
      allele should appear first or second, --export defaults to second for
      compatibility with PLINK 1.9.  Use 'ref-first' to change this.
      (Note that this doesn't apply to the 'A', 'AD', and 'Av' formats; use
      --export-allele to control which alleles are counted there.)
    * 'sample-v2' exports .sample files according to the QCTOOLv2 rather than
      the original specification.  Only one ID column is exported ('id-paste'
      and 'id-delim' settings apply), parental IDs are exported if present, and
      category names are preserved rather than converted to positive integers.

  --freq ['zs'] ['counts'] ['cols='<column set descriptor>] ['bins-only']
         ['refbins='<comma-separated bin boundaries> | 'refbins-file='<file>]
         ['alt1bins='<comma-separated bin boundaries> | 'alt1bins-file='<file>]
    Empirical allele frequency report.  By default, only founders are
    considered.  Dosages are taken into account (e.g. heterozygous haploid
    calls count as 0.5).
    Supported column sets are:
      chrom: Chromosome ID.
      pos: Base-pair coordinate.
      (ID is always present, and positioned here.)
      ref: Reference allele.
      alt1: Alternate allele 1.
      alt: All alternate alleles, comma-separated.
      reffreq: Reference allele frequency/dosage.
      alt1freq: Alt1 frequency/dosage.
      altfreq: Comma-separated frequencies/dosages for all alternate alleles.
      freq: Similar to altfreq, except ref is also included at the start.
      eq: Comma-separated <allele>=<freq> for all present alleles.  (If no
          alleles are present, the column contains a single '.'.)
      eqz: Same as eq, except zero-counts are included.
      alteq/alteqz: Same as eq/eqz, except reference allele is omitted.
      numeq: 0=<freq>,1=<freq>, etc.  Zero-counts are omitted.
      altnumeq: Same as numeq, except reference allele is omitted.
      machr2: Unphased MaCH imputation quality metric.
      minimac3r2: Phased Minimac3 imputation quality.
      nobs: Number of allele observations.
    The default is chrom,ref,alt,altfreq,nobs.
    Additional .afreq.{ref,alt1}.bins (or .acount.{ref,alt1}.bins with
    'counts') file(s) are generated when 'refbins='/'refbins-file=' or
    'alt1bins='/'alt1bins-file=' is present; these report the total number of
    frequencies or counts in each left-closed, right-open interval.  (If you
    only want these histogram(s), and not the main report, add 'bins-only'.)

  --geno-counts ['zs'] ['cols='<column set descriptor>]
    Variant-based hardcall genotype count report (considering both alleles
    simultaneously in the diploid case).  Nonfounders are now included; use
    --keep-founders if this is a problem.  Heterozygous haploid calls are
    treated as missing.
    Supported column sets are:
      chrom: Chromosome ID.
      pos: Base-pair coordinate.
      (ID is always present, and positioned here.)
      ref: Reference allele.
      alt1: Alternate allele 1.
      alt: All alternate alleles, comma-separated.
      homref: Homozygous-ref count.
      refalt1: Heterozygous ref-alt1 count.
      refalt: Comma-separated het ref-altx counts.
      homalt1: Homozygous-alt1 count.
      altxy: Comma-separated altx-alty counts, in (1/1)-(1/2)-(2/2)-(1/3)-...
             order.
      xy: Similar to altxy, except the reference allele is treated as alt0,
          and the sequence starts (0/0)-(0/1)-(1/1)-(0/2)-...
      hapref: Haploid-ref count.
      hapalt1: Haploid-alt1 count.
      hapalt: Comma-separated haploid-altx counts.
      hap: Similar to hapalts, except ref is also included at the start.
      numeq: 0/0=<hom ref ct>,0/1=<het ref-alt1>,1/1=<hom alt1>,...,0=<hap ref>
             etc.  Zero-counts are omitted.  (If all genotypes are missing, the
             column contains a single '.'.)
      missing: Number of missing genotypes.
      nobs: Number of (nonmissing) genotype observations.
    The default is chrom,ref,alt,homref,refalt,altxy,hapref,hapalt,missing.

  --sample-counts ['zs'] ['cols='<column set descriptor>]
    Sample-based hardcall genotype count report.
    * Unknown-sex samples are treated as female.
    * Heterozygous haploid calls (MT included) are treated as missing.
    * As with other PLINK 2 commands, SNPs that have not been left-normalized
      are counted as non-SNP non-symbolic.  (Use e.g. --normalize when that's a
      problem.)
    * Supported column sets are:
        maybefid: FID, if that column was present in the input.
        fid: Force FID column to be written even when absent in the input.
        (IID is always present, and positioned here.)
        maybesid: SID, if that column was present in the input.
        sid: Force SID column to be written even when absent in the input.
        sex: '1' = male, '2' = female, 'NA' = missing.
        hom: Homozygous genotype count.
        homref: Homozygous-ref genotype count.
        homalt: Homozygous-alt genotype count.

        refalt: Heterozygous ref-altx genotype count.
        het2alt: Heterozygous altx-alty genotype count.
        hetsnp: Heterozygous SNP count.
        dipts: Diploid SNP transition count.
        ts: SNP transition count (excluding chrY for females).

        symbolic: Symbolic variant count.
        nonsnp: Non-SNP count.
        dipsingle: Number of singletons relative to this dataset, across just
                   diploid calls.  (Note that if the ALT allele in a chrX
                   biallelic variant appears in exactly one female and one
                   male, that counts as a singleton for just the female.)
        single: Number of singletons relative to this dataset.
        haprefwfemaley: Haploid-ref count, counting chrY for everyone.
        hapref: Haploid-ref count, excluding chrY for females.
        hapaltwfemaley: Haploid-alt count, counting chrY for everyone.
        hapalt: Haploid-alt count, excluding chrY for females.
        missingwfemaley: Missing call count, counting chrY for everyone.
        missing: Missing call count, excluding chrY for females.
      The default is maybefid,maybesid,homref,homaltsnp,hetsnp,dipts,diptv,
      dipnonsnpsymb,dipsingle,haprefwfemaley,hapaltwfemaley,missingwfemaley.
    * The 'hetsnp', 'dipts'/'ts'/'diptv'/'tv', 'dipnonsnpsymb'/'nonsnpsymb',
      'symbolic', and 'nonsnp' columns count each ALT allele in a heterozygous
      altx-alty call separately, since they can be of different subtypes.
      (I.e. if they are of the same subtype, the corresponding count is
      incremented by 2.)  As a consequence, these columns are unaffected by
      variant split/join.

  --missing ['zs'] [{sample-only | variant-only}]
            ['scols='<column set descriptor>] ['vcols='<column set descriptor>]
    Generate sample- and variant-based missing data reports (or just one report
    if 'sample-only'/'variant-only' is specified).
    Mixed MT hardcalls appear in the heterozygous haploid stats.
    Supported column sets in the sample-based report are:
      maybefid: FID, if that column was present in the input.
      fid: Force FID column to be written even when absent in the input.
      (IID is always present, and positioned here.)
      maybesid: SID, if that column was present in the input.
      sid: Force SID column to be written even when absent in the input.
      misspheno1: First active phenotype missing (Y/N)?  Always 'Y' if no
                  phenotypes are loaded.
      missphenos: A Y/N column for each loaded phenotype.  (Can be combined
                  with misspheno1 to force at least one such column.)
      nmissdosage: Number of missing dosages.
      nmiss: Number of missing hardcalls, not counting het haploids.
      nmisshh: Number of missing hardcalls, counting het haploids.
      hethap: Number of heterozygous haploid hardcalls.
      nobs: Denominator (male count on chrY, otherwise total sample count).
      fmissdosage: Missing dosage rate.
      fmiss: Missing hardcall rate, not counting het haploids.
      fmisshh: Missing hardcall rate, counting het haploids.
    The default is maybefid,maybesid,missphenos,nmiss,nobs,fmiss.
    Supported column sets in the variant-based report are:
      chrom: Chromosome ID.
      pos: Base-pair coordinate.
      (ID is always present, and positioned here.)
      ref: Reference allele.
      alt1: Alternate allele 1.
      alt: All alternate alleles, comma-separated.
      nmissdosage: Number of missing dosages.
      nmiss: Number of missing hardcalls, not counting het haploids.
      nmisshh: Number of missing hardcalls, counting het haploids.
      hethap: Number of heterozygous haploid calls.
      nobs: Number of potentially valid calls.
      fmissdosage: Missing dosage rate.
      fmiss: Missing hardcall rate, not counting het haploids.
      fmisshh: Missing hardcall rate, counting het haploids.
      fhethap: Heterozygous haploid rate.
    The default is chrom,nmiss,nobs,fmiss.

  --hardy ['zs'] ['midp'] ['redundant'] ['cols='<column set descriptor>]
    Hardy-Weinberg exact test p-value report(s).
    * By default, only founders are considered; change this with --nonfounders.
    * chrX is now omitted from the main <output prefix>.hardy report.  Instead,
      (if present) it gets its own <output prefix>.hardy.x report based on the
      method described in Graffelman J, Weir BS (2016) Hardy-Weinberg
      equilibrium and the X chromosome.
    * For variants with k alleles where k>2, k separate 'biallelic' tests are
      performed, each reported on its own line.  However, biallelic variants
      are normally reported on a single line, since the counts/frequencies
      would be mirror-images and the p-values would be the same.  You can add
      the 'redundant' modifier to force biallelic variant results to be
      reported on two lines for parsing convenience.
    * There is currently no special handling of case/control phenotypes.
    Supported column sets are:
      chrom: Chromosome ID.
      pos: Base-pair coordinate.
      (ID is always present, and positioned here.)
      ref: Reference allele.
      alt1: Alternate allele 1.
      alt: All alternate alleles, comma-separated.
      (A1 is always present, and positioned here.)
      ax: Non-A1 allele(s), comma-separated.
      gcounts: Hom-A1 count, total number of het-A1 calls, and total number of
               nonmissing calls with no copies of A1.  On chrX, these are
               followed by male A1 and male non-A1 counts.
      gcount1col: gcounts values in a single comma-separated column.
      hetfreq: Observed and expected het-A1 frequencies.
      sexaf: Female and male A1 observed allele frequencies (chrX only).
      femalep: Female-only p/midp-value (chrX only).
      p: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium exact test p/midp-value.
    The default is chrom,ax,gcounts,hetfreq,sexaf,p.

  --het ['zs'] ['small-sample'] ['cols='<column set descriptor>]
    Inbreeding coefficient report.  Supports multiallelic variants.
    * This function requires decent MAF estimates.  If there are very few
      samples in your immediate fileset, --read-freq is practically mandatory
      since imputed MAFs are wildly inaccurate in that case.
    * It's usually best to perform this calculation on a variant set in
      approximate linkage equilibrium.
    * By default, --het omits the n/(n-1) multiplier in Nei's expected
      homozygosity formula.  The 'small-sample' modifier causes it to be
      included, while forcing --het to use MAFs imputed from founders in the
      immediate dataset.
    Supported column sets are:
      maybefid: FID, if that column was present in the input.
      fid: Force FID column to be written even when absent in the input.
      (IID is always present, and positioned here.)
      maybesid: SID, if that column was present in the input.
      sid: Force SID column to be written even when absent in the input.
      hom: Observed and expected numbers of homozygous genotypes.
      het: Observed and expected numbers of heterozygous genotypes.
      nobs: Number of (nonmissing) genotype observations.
      f: Method-of-moments F coefficient estimate.
    The default is maybefid,maybesid,hom,nobs,f.

  --fst <categorical or binary phenotype name> ['method='<method name>]
        ['blocksize='<jackknife block size>] ['cols='<column set descriptor>]
        ['report-variants'] ['zs'] ['vcols='<column set descriptor>]
        ['base='<pop. ID> | 'ids='<pop. ID> | 'file='<pop.-ID-pair file>]
        [other population ID(s) for base=/ids=...]
    Estimate Wright's Fst between pairs of populations.
    * Two methods are supported:
      * 'hudson': Bhatia G, Patterson N, Sankararaman S, Price AL (2013)
                  Estimating and interpreting F_{ST}: The impact of rare
                  variants.  This is now the default.
      * 'wc': Weir BS, Cockerham CC (1984) Estimating F-statistics for the
              analysis of population structure.
    * To get block-jackknife-based standard error estimates, provide a
      blocksize= value.
    * There is only one optional column set in the main summary:
        (POP1 and POP2 are always present, and positioned here.)
        nobs: Number of variants with valid Fst estimates.
        (HUDSON_FST or WC_FST is always present, and positioned here.)
        (SE is present if blocksize= specified, and positioned here.)
      nobs is not included by default.
    * You can request per-variant Fst estimates with the 'report-variants'
      modifier; this generates a separate output file for each population pair.
      Supported per-variant report column sets are:
        chrom: Chromosome ID.
        pos: Base-pair coordinate.
        (ID is always present, and positioned here.)
        ref: Reference allele.
        alt: All alternate alleles, comma-separated.
        nobs: Number of (nonmissing) genotype observations across pop pair.
        nallele: Number of nonmissing alleles.
        fstfrac: Numerator and denominator of Fst estimate.
        fst: Fst estimate.
      The default is chrom,pos,nobs,fst.
    * By default, all pairs of populations are compared.  If you only want to
      compare some pairs, there are three ways to do this.
      * base= specifies one base population to be compared with all others; or
        if you specify more population ID(s) afterward, just the other
        populations you've listed.
      * ids= specifies an all-vs.-all comparison within the given set of
        populations.
      * file= specifies a file containing one population pair per line.
      Note that 'base='/'ids='/'file=' must be positioned after all modifiers.

  --indep-pairwise <window size>['kb'] [step size (variant ct)]
                   <unphased-hardcall-r^2 threshold>
    Generate a list of variants in approximate linkage equilibrium.
    * For multiallelic variants, major allele counts are used in the r^2
      computation.
    * With the 'kb' modifier, the window size is in kilobase instead of variant
      count units.  (Pre-'kb' space is optional, i.e.
      "--indep-pairwise 500 kb 0.5" and "--indep-pairwise 500kb 0.5" have the
      same effect.)
    * The step size now defaults to 1 if it's unspecified, and *must* be 1 if
      the window is in kilobase units.
    * Note that you need to rerun PLINK using --extract or --exclude on the
      .prune.in/.prune.out file to apply the list to another computation... and
      as with other applications of --extract/--exclude, duplicate variant IDs
      are a problem.  --indep-pairwise now errors out when duplicate variant
      IDs are present.

  --ld <variant ID> <variant ID> ['dosage'] ['hwe-midp']
    This displays diplotype frequencies, r^2, and D' for a single pair of
    variants.
    * For multiallelic variants, major allele counts/dosages are used.
    * Phase information is used when both variants are on the same chromosome.
    * When there is at least one sample with unphased het calls for both
      variants, diplotype frequencies are estimated using the Hill equation.
      If there are multiple biologically possible local maxima, all are
      displayed, along with HWE exact test statistics.
    * By default, only hardcalls are considered.  Add the 'dosage' modifier if
      you want dosages to be taken into account.  (In the diploid case, an
      unphased dosage of x is interpreted as P(0/0) = 1 - x, P(0/1) = x when x
      is in 0..1.)

  --sample-diff ['id-delim='<char>] ['dosage' | 'dosage='<tolerance>]
                ['include-missing'] [{pairwise | counts-only}]
                ['fname-id-delim='<c>] ['zs'] ['cols='<column set descriptor>]
                ['counts-cols='<column set descriptor>]
                {base= | ids=}<sample ID> <other sample ID(s)...>
  --sample-diff ['id-delim='<char>] ['dosage' | 'dosage='<tolerance>]
                ['include-missing'] [{pairwise | counts-only}]
                ['fname-id-delim='<c>] ['zs'] ['cols='<column set descriptor>]
                ['counts-cols='<column set descriptor>] file=<ID-pair file>
    (alias: --sdiff)
    Report discordances and discordance-counts between pairs of samples.  If
    chrX or chrY is present, sex must be defined and consistent.
    * There are three ways to specify which sample pairs to compare.  To
      compare a single baseline sample against some others, start the
      (space-delimited) sample ID list with 'base='.  To perform an all-vs.-all
      comparison, start it with 'ids=' instead.  To compare sample pairs listed
      in a file, use 'file='.
      Note that 'base='/'ids='/'file=' must be positioned after all modifiers.
    * Sample IDs are interpreted as if they were in a VCF header line, with
      'id-delim=' having the usual effect.
    * By default, comparisons are based on hardcalls.  Use 'dosage' to compare
      dosages instead; you can combine this with a tolerance in [0, 0.5).
    * By default, if one genotype is missing and the other isn't, that doesn't
      count as a difference; this can be changed with 'include-missing'.
    * By default, a single main report is written to
      <output prefix>[.<base ID>].sdiff.  To write separate pairwise
      <output prefix>.<ID1>.<ID2>.sdiff reports for each compared ID pair, add
      the 'pairwise' modifier.  To omit the main report, add the 'counts-only'
      modifier.  (Note that, if you're only interested in nonmissing autosomal
      biallelic hardcalls, --make-king-table provides a more efficient way to
      compute just counts.)
    * By default, if an output filename has a multipart sample ID, the parts
      will be delimited by '_'; use 'fname-id-delim=' to change this.
    Supported main-report column sets are:
      chrom: Chromosome ID.
      pos: Base-pair coordinate.
      (Variant ID is always present, and positioned here.)
      ref: Reference allele.
      alt: All alternate alleles, comma-separated.
      maybefid: FID1/FID2, if that column was in the input.  Requires 'id'.
      fid: Force FID1/FID2 even when FID was absent in the input.
      id: IID1/IID2.
      maybesid: SID1/SID2, if that column was in the input.  Requires 'id'.
      sid: Force SID1/SID2 even when SID was absent in the input.
      geno: Unphased GT or DS for the two samples.
    The default is usually chrom,pos,ref,alt,maybefid,id,maybesid,geno; the
    sample IDs are removed from the default in 'pairwise' mode.
    Supported discordance-count-summary column sets are:
      maybefid: FID1/FID2, if that column was in the input.
      fid: Force FID1/FID2 even when FID was absent in the input.
      (IID1/IID2 are always present.)
      maybesid: SID1/SID2, if that column was in the input.
      sid: Force SID1/SID2 even when SID was absent in the input.
      nobs: Number of variants considered.  This includes variants where one or
            both variants are missing iff 'include-missing' was specified.
      nobsibs: ibs0+ibs1+ibs2.
      ibs0: Number of diploid variants with no common hardcall alleles.
      ibs1: Number of diploid variants with exactly 1 common hardcall allele.
      ibs2: Number of diploid variants with both hardcall alleles matching.
      halfmiss: Number of variants with exactly 1 missing genotype/dosage.
                Ignored without 'include-missing'.
      diff: Total number of differences.
    The default is maybefid,maybesid,nobs,halfmiss,diff.

  --make-king [{square | square0 | triangle}] [{zs | bin | bin4}]
    KING-robust kinship estimator, described by Manichaikul A, Mychaleckyj JC,
    Rich SS, Daly K, Sale M, Chen WM (2010) Robust relationship inference in
    genome-wide association studies.  By default, this writes a
    lower-triangular tab-delimited table of kinship coefficients to
    <output prefix>.king, and a list of the corresponding sample IDs to
    <output prefix>.king.id.  The first row of the .king file contains a single
    <genome 1-genome 2> kinship coefficient, the second row has the
    <genome 1-genome 3> and <genome 2-genome 3> kinship values in that order,
    etc.
    * Only autosomes are currently considered.
    * Pedigree information is currently ignored; the between-family estimator
      is used for all pairs.
    * For multiallelic variants, REF allele counts are used.
    * If the 'square' or 'square0' modifier is present, a square matrix is
      written instead; 'square0' fills the upper right triangle with zeroes.
    * If the 'zs' modifier is present, the .king file is Zstd-compressed.
    * If the 'bin' modifier is present, a binary (square) matrix of
      double-precision floating point values, suitable for loading from R, is
      instead written to <output prefix>.king.bin.  ('bin4' specifies
      single-precision numbers instead.)  This can be combined with 'square0'
      if you still want the upper right zeroed out, or 'triangle' if you don't
      want to pad the upper right at all.
    * The computation can be subdivided with --parallel.
  --make-king-table ['zs'] ['counts'] ['rel-check'] ['cols='<col set descrip.>]
    Similar to --make-king, except results are reported in KING's original
    .kin0 text table format (with minor changes, e.g. row order is more
    friendly to incremental addition of samples), --king-table-filter can be
    used to restrict the report to high kinship values, and the 'rel-check'
    modifier can be used to restrict to same-FID pairs.
    Supported column sets are:
      maybefid: FID1/FID2, if that column was in the input.  Requires 'id'.
      fid: Force FID1/FID2 even when FID was absent in the input.
      id: IID1/IID2.
      maybesid: SID1/SID2, if that column was in the input.  Requires 'id'.
      sid: Force SID1/SID2 even when SID was absent in the input.
      nsnp: Number of variants considered (autosomal, neither call missing).
      hethet: Proportion/count of considered call pairs which are het-het.
      ibs0: Proportion/count of considered call pairs which are opposite homs.
      ibs1: HET1_HOM2 and HET2_HOM1 proportions/counts.
      kinship: KING-robust between-family kinship estimator.
    The default is maybefid,id,maybesid,nsnp,hethet,ibs0,kinship.
    hethet/ibs0/ibs1 values are proportions unless the 'counts' modifier is
    present.  If id is omitted, a .kin0.id file is also written.

  --make-rel ['cov'] ['meanimpute'] [{square | square0 | triangle}]
             [{zs | bin | bin4}]
    Write a lower-triangular variance-standardized relationship matrix to
    <output prefix>.rel, and corresponding IDs to <output prefix>.rel.id.
    * This computation assumes that variants do not have very low MAF, or
      deviate greatly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
    * Also, it's usually best to perform this calculation on a variant set in
      approximate linkage equilibrium.
    * The 'cov' modifier replaces the variance-standardization step with basic
      mean-centering, causing a covariance matrix to be calculated instead.
    * The computation can be subdivided with --parallel.
  --make-grm-list ['cov'] ['meanimpute'] ['zs'] [{id-header | iid-only}]
  --make-grm-bin ['cov'] ['meanimpute'] [{id-header | iid-only}]
    --make-grm-list causes the relationships to be written to GCTA's original
    list format, which describes one pair per line, while --make-grm-bin writes
    them in GCTA 1.1+'s single-precision triangular binary format.  Note that
    these formats explicitly report the number of valid observations (where
    neither sample has a missing call) for each pair, which is useful input for
    some scripts.

  --pca [count] [{approx | meanimpute}] ['scols='<col set descriptor>]
  --pca [{allele-wts | biallelic-var-wts}] [count] [{approx | meanimpute}]
        ['vzs'] ['scols='<col set descriptor>] ['vcols='<col set descriptor>]
    Extracts top principal components from the variance-standardized
    relationship matrix.
    * It is usually best to perform this calculation on a variant set in
      approximate linkage equilibrium, with no very-low-MAF variants.
    * By default, 10 PCs are extracted; you can adjust this by passing a
      numeric argument.  (Note that 10 is lower than the PLINK 1.9 default of
      20; this is due to the randomized algorithm's memory footprint growing
      quadratically w.r.t. the PC count.)
    * The 'approx' modifier causes the standard deterministic computation to be
      replaced with the randomized algorithm originally implemented for
      Galinsky KJ, Bhatia G, Loh PR, Georgiev S, Mukherjee S, Patterson NJ,
      Price AL (2016) Fast Principal-Component Analysis Reveals Convergent
      Evolution of ADH1B in Europe and East Asia.  This can be a good idea when
      you have >5k samples, and is almost required with >50k.
    * The randomized algorithm always uses mean imputation for missing genotype
      calls.  For comparison purposes, you can use the 'meanimpute' modifier to
      request this behavior for the standard computation.
    * 'scols=' can be used to customize how sample IDs appear in the .eigenvec
      file.  (maybefid, fid, maybesid, and sid supported; default is
      maybefid,maybesid.)
    * The 'allele-wts' modifier requests an additional one-line-per-allele
      .eigenvec.allele file with PCs expressed as allele weights instead of
      sample weights.  When it's present, 'vzs' causes the .eigenvec.allele
      file to be Zstd-compressed.
      'vcols=' can be used to customize the report columns; supported column
      sets are:
        chrom: Chromosome ID.
        pos: Base-pair coordinate.
        (ID is always present, and positioned here.)
        ref: Reference allele.
        alt1: Alternate allele 1.
        alt: All alternate alleles, comma-separated.
        (A1 is always present, and positioned here.)
        ax: Non-A1 alleles, comma-separated.
        (PCs are always present, and positioned here.)
      Default is chrom,ref,alt.
    * For datasets with no multiallelic variants, the 'biallelic-var-wts'
      modifier requests the old .eigenvec.var format, which only reports
      weights for major alleles.  (These weights are 2x the corresponding
      .eigenvec.allele weights.)  Supported column sets are:
        chrom: Chromosome ID.
        pos: Base-pair coordinate.
        (ID is always present, and positioned here.)
        ref: Reference allele.
        alt1: Alternate allele 1.
        alt: All alternate alleles, comma-separated.
        maj: Major allele.
        nonmaj: Minor allele.
        (PCs are always present, and positioned here.  Signs are w.r.t. the
        major, not necessarily reference, allele.)
      Default is chrom,maj,nonmaj.

  --king-cutoff [.king.bin + .king.id fileset prefix] <threshold>
    Exclude one member of each pair of samples with KING-robust kinship greater
    than the given threshold.  Remaining/excluded sample IDs are written to
    <output prefix>.king.cutoff.in.id + .king.cutoff.out.id.
    If present, the .king.bin file must be triangular (either precision is ok).

  --write-covar ['cols='<column set descriptor>]
    If covariates are defined, an updated version (with all filters applied) is
    automatically written to <output prefix>.cov whenever --make-pgen,
    --make-just-psam, --export, or a similar command is present.  However, if
    you do not wish to simultaneously generate a new sample file, you can use
    --write-covar to just produce a pruned covariate file.
    Supported column sets are:
      maybefid: FID, if that column was in the input.
      fid: Force FID column to be written even when absent in the input.
      maybesid: SID, if that column was in the input.
      sid: Force SID column to be written even when absent in the input.
      maybeparents: Father/mother IIDs ('0' = missing), if columns in input.
      parents: Force PAT/MAT columns to be written even when absent in input.
      sex: '1' = male, '2' = female, 'NA' = missing.
      pheno1: First active phenotype.  If none, all column entries are set to
              the --output-missing-phenotype string.
      phenos: All active phenotypes, if any.  (Can be combined with pheno1 to
              force at least one phenotype column to be written.)
      (Covariates are always present, and positioned here.)
    The default is maybefid,maybesid.

  --pmerge <.pgen/.bed filename> <.pvar/.bim> <.psam/.fam>
  --pmerge <.pgen + .pvar + .psam fileset prefix> ['vzs']
    Merge the given fileset with the initially loaded fileset, writing the
    result to <output prefix>.pgen + .pvar + .psam.
  --pmerge-list <filename> [mode]
    Merge all filesets named in the text file.  Also merge with the initially
    loaded fileset if one was specified.
    When a line in the text file contains three entries, they are interpreted
    as full filenames for a binary fileset (.pgen/.bed, then .pvar/.bim, then
    .psam/.fam).  If it contains exactly one entry, its interpretation depends
    on the mode:
    * 'bfile': Prefix for .bed + .bim + .fam fileset.
    * 'bpfile': Prefix for .pgen + .bim + .fam fileset.
    * 'pfile' (default): Prefix for .pgen + .pvar + .psam fileset.
    * 'pfile-vzs': Prefix for .pgen + .pvar.zst + .psam fileset.
    For both --pmerge and --pmerge-list:
    * All input filesets must be sorted by position, and have the same
      chromosome order.  (When this isn't true, use --make-pgen + --sort-vars
      on each fileset first.)
    * Variants are only merged if their IDs AND positions match.  (This is a
      change from PLINK 1.x.)

  --pgen-diff <.pgen/.bed filename> <.pvar/.bim> <.psam/.fam>
              ['include-missing'] ['zs'] ['dosage' | 'dosage='<tolerance>]
              ['cols='<column set descriptor>]
  --pgen-diff <.pgen + .pvar + .psam prefix> ['vzs'] ['include-missing'] ['zs']
              ['dosage' | 'dosage='<tolerance>] ['cols='<col set descriptor>]
    Report unphased genotype/dosage differences in the intersection of two
    filesets.  (Sample and variant filters are also applied.)
    * If chrX or chrY is present, sex must be defined and consistent.
    * Variants are only compared if their IDs AND positions match.  An error
      is reported if any such match is not unique.
    * By default, comparisons are based on hardcalls.  Use 'dosage' to compare
      dosages instead; you can combine this with a tolerance in [0, 0.5).
    * By default, if one genotype is missing and the other isn't, that doesn't
      count as a difference; this can be changed with 'include-missing'.
    Supported column sets are:
      chrom: Chromosome ID.
      pos: Base-pair coordinate.
      id: Variant ID.
      ref: Reference allele.
      alt: All alternate alleles across both filesets, comma-separated.
      maybefid: FID, if that column was present in the input.
      fid: Force FID column to be written even when absent in the input.
      (IID is always present, and positioned here.)
      maybesid: SID, if that column was present in the input.
      sid: Force SID column to be written even when absent in the input.
      geno: Unphased GT or DS.
    The default is id,maybefid,maybesid,geno.

  --write-samples
    Report IDs of all samples which pass your filters/inclusion thresholds.

  --write-snplist ['zs'] ['allow-dups']
    List all variants which pass your filters/inclusion thresholds.  Unless the
    'allow-dups' modifier is provided, this now errors out when duplicate
    variant ID(s) remain.

  --glm ['zs'] ['omit-ref'] [{sex | no-x-sex}] ['log10'] ['pheno-ids']
        [{genotypic | hethom | dominant | recessive | hetonly}] ['interaction']
        ['hide-covar'] ['skip-invalid-pheno'] ['allow-no-covars']
        [{intercept | cc-residualize | firth-residualize}]
        [{no-firth | firth-fallback | firth}] ['cols='<col set desc>]
        ['local-covar='<file>] ['local-psam='<file>]
        ['local-pos-cols='<key col #s> | 'local-pvar='<file>] ['local-haps']
        ['local-omit-last' | 'local-cats[0]='<category ct>]
    Basic association analysis on quantitative and/or case/control phenotypes.
    For each variant, a linear (for quantitative traits) or logistic (for
    case/control) regression is run with the phenotype as the dependent
    variable, and nonmajor allele dosage(s) and a constant-1 column as
    predictors.
    * There is usually an additive effect line for every nonmajor allele, and
      no such line for the major allele.  To omit REF alleles instead of major
      alleles, add the 'omit-ref' modifier.  (When performing interaction
      testing, this tends to cause the multicollinearity check to fail for
      low-ref-frequency variants.)
    * By default, sex (male = 1, female = 2; note that this is a change from
      PLINK 1.x) is automatically added as a predictor for X chromosome
      variants, and no others.  The 'sex' modifier causes it to be added
      everywhere (except chrY), while 'no-x-sex' excludes it entirely.
    * The 'log10' modifier causes p-values to be reported in -log10(p) form.
    * 'pheno-ids' causes the samples used in each set of regressions to be
      written to an .id file.  (When the samples differ on chrX or chrY, .x.id
      and/or .y.id files are also written.)
    * The 'genotypic' modifier adds an additive effect/dominance deviation 2df
      joint test (0-2 and 0..1..0 coding), while 'hethom' uses 0..0..1 and
      0..1..0 coding instead.
    * 'dominant' and 'recessive' specify a model assuming full dominance or
      recessiveness, respectively, for the ref allele.  I.e. the genotype
      column is recoded as 0..1..1 or 0..0..1, respectively.
    * 'hetonly' replaces the genotype column with a dominance-deviation column.
    * 'interaction' adds genotype x covariate interactions to the model.  Note
      that this tends to produce 'NA' results (due to the multicollinearity
      check) when the reference allele is 'wrong'; --maj-ref can be used to
      enable analysis of those variants.
    * Additional predictors can be added with --covar.  By default, association
      statistics are reported for all nonconstant predictors; 'hide-covar'
      suppresses covariate-only results, while 'intercept' causes intercepts
      to be reported.
      Since running --glm without at least e.g. principal component covariates
      is usually an analytical mistake, the 'allow-no-covars' modifier is now
      required when you're intentionally running --glm without a covariate
      file.
    * By default, if the current phenotype and covariates are such that every
      regression on a chromosome will fail, PLINK 2 errors out.  To just skip
      the phenotype or chromosome instead, add the 'skip-invalid-pheno'
      modifier.
    * There are now three regression modes for case/control phenotypes:
      * 'no-firth' requests PLINK 1.x's behavior, where a NA result is reported
        when basic logistic regression fails to converge.
      * 'firth-fallback' requests logistic regression, followed by Firth
        regression whenever the logistic regression fails to converge.  This is
        now the default.
      * 'firth' requests Firth regression all the time.
    * Firth regression can be slow.  To trade off some accuracy for speed, you
      can use the 'firth-residualize' modifier, which implements the shortcut
      described in Mbatchou J et al. (2020) Computationally efficient whole
      genome regression for quantitative and binary traits.  (You can also use
      'cc-residualize' to force this shortcut to be applied to basic logistic
      regression as well.)
      * This must be used with 'hide-covar', and disables some other --glm
        features.
    * To add covariates which are not constant across all variants, add the
      'local-covar=' and 'local-psam=' modifiers, use full filenames for each,
      and use either 'local-pvar=' or 'local-pos-cols=' to provide variant ID
      or position information.
      Normally, the local-covar file should have c * n real-valued columns,
      where the first c columns correspond to the first sample in the
      local-psam file, columns (c+1) to 2c correspond to the second sample,
      etc.; and the mth line corresponds to the mth nonheader line of the
      local-pvar file when there is one.  (Variants outside of the local-pvar
      file are excluded from the regression.)  The local covariates are
      assigned the names LOCAL1, LOCAL2, etc.; to exclude the last local
      covariate from the regression (necessary if they are e.g. local ancestry
      coefficients which sum to 1), add 'local-omit-last'.
      Alternatively, with 'local-cats='<k>, the local-covar file is expected to
      have n columns with integer-valued entries in [1, k].  (This range is
      [0, k-1] with 'local-cats0='.)  These category assignments are expanded
      into (k-1) local covariates in the usual manner.
      When position information is in the local-covar file, this should be
      indicated by 'local-pos-cols='<number of header rows>,<chrom col #>,<pos
      start col #>,<first covariate col #>.
      'local-haps' indicates that there's one column or column-group per
      haplotype instead of per sample; they are averaged by --glm.
    The main report supports the following column sets:
      chrom: Chromosome ID.
      pos: Base-pair coordinate.
      (ID is always present, and positioned here.)
      ref: Reference allele.
      alt1: Alternate allele 1.
      alt: All alternate alleles, comma-separated.
      (A1 is always present, and positioned here.  For multiallelic variants,
      this column may contain multiple comma-separated alleles when the result
      doesn't depend on which allele is A1.)
      ax: Non-A1 alleles, comma-separated.
      a1count: A1 allele count (can be decimal with dosage data).
      totallele: Allele observation count (can be higher than --freq value, due
                 to inclusion of het haploids and chrX model).
      a1countcc: A1 count in cases, then controls (case/control only).
      totallelecc: Case and control allele observation counts.
      gcountcc: Genotype hardcall counts (neither-A1, het-A1, A1-A1) in cases,
                then controls (case/control only).
      a1freq: A1 allele frequency.
      a1freqcc: A1 frequency in cases, then controls (case/control only).
      machr2: Unphased MaCH imputation quality (frequently labeled 'INFO').
      firth: Reports whether Firth regression was used (firth-fallback only).
      test: Test identifier.  (Required unless only one test is run.)
      nobs: Number of samples in the regression.
      beta: Regression coefficient (for A1 if additive test).
      orbeta: Odds ratio for case/control, beta for quantitative traits.
              (Ignored if 'beta' column set included.)
      se: Standard error of beta.
      ci: Bounds of symmetric approximate confidence interval (requires --ci).
      tz: T-statistic for linear regression, Wald Z-score for logistic/Firth.
      p: Asymptotic p-value (or -log10(p)) for T/Z-statistic.
      err: Error code for NA results.
    The default is chrom,pos,ref,alt,firth,test,nobs,orbeta,se,ci,tz,p,err.

  --score <filename> [i] [j] [k] [{header | header-read}]
          [{center | variance-standardize | dominant | recessive}]
          ['no-mean-imputation'] ['se'] ['zs'] ['ignore-dup-ids']
          [{list-variants | list-variants-zs}] ['cols='<col set descriptor>]
    Apply linear scoring system(s) to each sample.
    The input file should have one line per scored (variant, allele) pair.
    Variant IDs are read from column #i and allele codes are read from column
    #j, where i defaults to 1 and j defaults to i+1.
    * By default, a single column of input coefficients is read from column #k,
      where k defaults to j+1.  (--score-col-nums can be used to specify
      multiple columns.)
    * 'header-read' causes the first line of the input file to be treated as a
      header line containing score names.  Otherwise, score(s) are assigned the
      names 'SCORE1', 'SCORE2', etc.; and 'header' just causes the first line
      to be entirely ignored.
    * By default, copies of unnamed alleles contribute zero to score, while
      missing genotypes contribute an amount proportional to the loaded (via
      --read-freq) or imputed allele frequency.  To throw out missing
      observations instead (decreasing the denominator in the final average
      when this happens), use the 'no-mean-imputation' modifier.
    * You can use the 'center' modifier to shift all genotypes to mean zero, or
      'variance-standardize' to linearly transform the genotypes to mean-0,
      variance-1.
    * The 'dominant' modifier causes dosages greater than 1 to be treated as 1,
      while 'recessive' uses max(dosage - 1, 0) on diploid chromosomes.
      ('dominant', 'recessive', and 'variance-standardize' cannot be used with
      chrX.)
    * The 'se' modifier causes the input coefficients to be treated as
      independent standard errors; in this case, standard errors for the score
      average/sum are reported, under a Gaussian approximation.  (Note that
      this will systematically underestimate standard errors when scored
      variants are in LD.)
    * By default, --score errors out if a variant ID in the input file appears
      multiple times in the main dataset.  Use the 'ignore-dup-ids' modifier to
      skip them instead (a warning is still printed if such variants are
      present).
    * The 'list-variants[-zs]' modifier causes variant IDs used for scoring to
      be written to <output prefix>.sscore.vars[.zst].
    The main report supports the following column sets:
      maybefid: FID, if that column was in the input.
      fid: Force FID column to be written even when absent in the input.
      (IID is always present, and positioned here.)
      maybesid: SID, if that column was in the input.
      sid: Force SID column to be written even when absent in the input.
      pheno1: First active phenotype.
      phenos: All active phenotypes, if any.
      nallele: Number of nonmissing alleles.
      denom: Denominator of score average (equal to nallele value when
             'no-mean-imputation' specified).
      dosagesum: Sum of named allele dosages.
      scoreavgs: Score averages.
      scoresums: Score sums.
    The default is maybefid,maybesid,phenos,nallele,dosagesum,scoreavgs.
    For more sophisticated polygenic risk scoring, we recommend looking at the
    LDpred2 (https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/articles/LDpred2.html ) and
    PRSice-2 (https://www.prsice.info/ ) software packages.

  --variant-score <filename> ['bin' | 'bin4' | 'cols='<col set descriptor>]
                  ['zs'] ['single-prec']
    (alias: --vscore)
    Apply linear scoring system(s) to each variant.  Each reported variant
    score is the dot product of a sample-weight vector with the
    total-ALT-dosage vector, with MAF-based mean imputation applied to missing
    dosages.
    Input file format: one line per sample, each starting with an ID and
    followed by scoring weight(s); it can also have a header line with the
    sample ID representation and the score name(s).
    The usual .vscore text report supports the following column sets:
      chrom: Chromosome ID.
      pos: Base-pair coordinate.
      (ID is always present, and positioned here.)
      ref: Reference allele.
      alt1: Alternate allele 1.
      alt: All alternate alleles, comma-separated.
      altfreq: ALT allele frequency used for mean-imputation.
      nmiss: Number of missing (and thus mean-imputed) dosages.
      nobs: Number of (nonmissing) sample observations.
      (Variant scores are always present, and positioned here.)
    Default is chrom,pos,ref,alt.
    If binary output is requested instead, the main .vscore.bin matrix contains
    floating-point values, column (score) ID(s) are saved to
    <output prefix>.vscore.cols, and variant IDs are saved to
    <output prefix>.vscore.vars[.zst].
    'single-prec' causes the computation to use single- instead of
    double-precision floating-point values internally.

  --adjust-file <filename> ['zs'] ['gc'] ['cols='<column set descriptor>]
                ['log10'] ['input-log10'] ['test='<test name, case-sensitive>]
    Given a file with unfiltered association test results, report some basic
    multiple-testing corrections, sorted in increasing-p-value order.
    * 'gc' causes genomic-controlled p-values to be used in the formulas.
      (This tends to be overly conservative.  We note that LD Score regression
      usually does a better job of calibrating lambda; see Lee JJ, McGue M,
      Iacono WG, Chow CC (2018) The accuracy of LD Score regression as an
      estimator of confounding and genetic correlations in genome-wide
      association studies.)
    * 'log10' causes negative base 10 logs of p-values to be reported, instead
      of raw p-values.  'input-log10' specifies that the input file contains
      -log10(p) values.
    * If the input file contains multiple tests per variant which are
      distinguished by a 'TEST' column (true for --linear/--logistic/--glm),
      you must use 'test=' to select the test to process.
    The following column sets are supported:
      chrom: Chromosome ID.
      pos: Base-pair coordinate.
      (ID is always present, and positioned here.)
      ref: Reference allele.
      alt1: Alternate allele 1.
      alt: All alternate alleles, comma-separated.
      a1: Tested allele.  (Omitted if missing from input file.)
      unadj: Unadjusted p-value.
      gc: Devlin & Roeder (1999) genomic control corrected p-value (additive
          models only).
      qq: P-value quantile.
      bonf: Bonferroni correction.
      holm: Holm-Bonferroni (1979) adjusted p-value.
      sidakss: Sidak single-step adjusted p-value.
      sidaksd: Sidak step-down adjusted p-value.
      fdrbh: Benjamini & Hochberg (1995) step-up false discovery control.
      fdrby: Benjamini & Yekutieli (2001) step-up false discovery control.
    Default set is chrom,a1,unadj,gc,bonf,holm,sidakss,sidaksd,fdrbh,fdrby.
  --genotyping-rate ['dosage']
    Report genotyping rate in log (this was automatic in PLINK 1.x).

  --pgen-info
    Reports basic information about a .pgen file.

  --validate
    Validates all variant records in a .pgen file.

  --zst-decompress <.zst file> [output filename]
    (alias: --zd)
    Decompress a Zstd-compressed file.  If no output filename is specified, the
    file is decompressed to standard output.
    This cannot be used with any other flags, and does not cause a log file to
    be generated.

The following other flags are supported.
  --script <fname>    : Include command-line options from file.
  --rerun [log]       : Rerun commands in log (default 'plink2.log').
  --version           : Display only version number before exiting.
  --silent            : Suppress regular output to console.  (Error-output is
                        not suppressed.)
  --double-id         : When importing single-part sample IDs, set both FID and
                        IID to the original ID.
  --const-fid [ID]    : When importing single-part sample IDs, set FID to the
                        given constant and IID to the original ID.
  --id-delim [d]      : Normally parses single-delimiter sample IDs as
                        <FID><d><IID>, and double-delimiter IDs as
                        <FID><d><IID><d><SID>; default delimiter is '_'.
                        --id-delim can no longer be used with
                        --double-id/--const-fid; it will error out if any ID
                        lacks the delimiter.
  --idspace-to <c>    : Convert spaces in VCF/.bgen sample IDs to the given
                        character.
  --iid-sid           : Make --id-delim, --indv, and --sample-diff interpret
                        two-token sample IDs as IID-SID instead of FID-IID.
  --vcf-require-gt    : Skip variants with no GT field.
  --vcf-min-gq <val>  : No-call genotypes when GQ is present and below the
                        threshold.
  --vcf-max-dp <val>  : No-call genotypes when DP is present and above/below
  --vcf-min-dp <val>    the threshold.
  --vcf-half-call <m> : Specify how '0/.' and similar VCF GT values should be
                        handled.  The following four modes are supported:
                        * 'error'/'e' (default) errors out and reports line #.
                        * 'haploid'/'h' treats them as haploid calls.
                        * 'missing'/'m' treats them as missing.
                        * 'reference'/'r' treats the missing value as 0.
  --vcf-ref-n-missing : Import VCF 'N' REF alleles as missing alleles.  This
                        can be appropriate for .ped-derived VCFs.
  --oxford-single-chr <chr name>  : Specify single-chromosome .gen/.bgen file
                                    with no useful chromosome info inside.
  --missing-code [string list]    : Comma-delimited list of missing phenotype
    (alias: --missing_code)         values for Oxford-format import (default
                                    'NA').
  --hard-call-threshold <val>     : When importing dosage data, a hardcall is
                                    normally saved when the distance from the
                                    nearest hardcall, defined as
                                      0.5 * sum_i |x_i - round(x_i)|
                                    (where the x_i's are 0..2 allele dosages),
                                    is not greater than 0.1.  You can adjust
                                    this threshold by providing a numeric
                                    argument to --hard-call-threshold.
                                    You can also use this with --make-[b]pgen
                                    to alter the saved hardcalls while leaving
                                    the dosages untouched, or --make-bed to
                                    tweak hardcall export.
  --dosage-erase-threshold <val>  : --hard-call-threshold normally preserves
                                    the original dosages, and several PLINK 2
                                    commands use them when they're available.
                                    Use --dosage-erase-threshold to make PLINK
                                    2 erase dosages and keep only hardcalls
                                    when distance-from-hardcall <= the given
                                    level.
  --import-dosage-certainty <val> : The PLINK 2 file format currently supports
                                    a single dosage for each allele.  Some
                                    other dosage file formats include a
                                    separate probability for every possible
                                    genotype, e.g. {P(0/0)=0.2, P(0/1)=0.52,
                                    P(1/1)=0.28}, a highly uncertain call that
                                    is nevertheless treated as a hardcall under
                                    '--hard-call-threshold 0.1'.  To make PLINK
                                    2 treat a dosage as missing whenever the
                                    largest probability is less than a
                                    threshold, use --import-dosage-certainty.
  --input-missing-genotype <c> : '.' is always interpreted as a missing
                                 genotype code in input files.  By default, '0'
                                 also is; you can change this second missing
                                 code with --input-missing-genotype.
  --allow-extra-chr  : Permit unrecognized chromosome codes (alias --aec).
  --chr-set <autosome ct> ['no-x'] ['no-y'] ['no-xy'] ['no-mt'] :
    Specify a nonhuman chromosome set.  The first parameter sets the number of
    diploid autosome pairs if positive, or haploid chromosomes if negative.
    Given diploid autosomes, the remaining modifiers indicate the absence of
    the named non-autosomal chromosomes.
  --cow/--dog/--horse/--mouse/--rice/--sheep : Shortcuts for those species.
  --autosome-num <val>    : Alias for '--chr-set <value> no-y no-xy no-mt'.
  --human                 : Explicitly specify human chromosome set, and make
                            output .pvar/VCF files include a ##chrSet header
                            line.  (.pvar/VCF output files automatically
                            include ##chrSet when a nonhuman set is specified.)
  --chr-override ['file'] : By default, if --chr-set/--autosome-num/--cow/etc.
